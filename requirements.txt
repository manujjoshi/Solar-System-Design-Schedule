🚀 Open to Remote Opportunities | Data Scientist | Generative AI | 3+ Years of Experience

Hi everyone! I’m currently open to remote roles where I can apply my expertise in Data Science, Generative AI, and Intelligent Automation to create value-driven solutions at scale.

With 3+ years of industry experience, I bring hands-on knowledge in:

🔹 Generative AI, LLMs (LLaMA, GPT, Mistral), RAG Pipelines, AI Agents

 🔹 Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision

 🔹 SQL, Databricks, API Development

 🔹 Streamlit, Power BI, Tableau

 🔹 Azure (AI-102, DP-100, AI-900 Certified)

📌 Highlighted Projects:

🤖 LLM Optimization with RAG Pipeline – Deployed retrieval-augmented generation for scalable enterprise search.

🔧 API Task Scheduling Agent – Built an agent that automates API calls based on workflow triggers.

📊 AI-Powered SQL Generation Agent – Empowered non-technical users to generate database queries using LLMs.

🌞 Real-Time Solar Dashboard Migration to Azure – Created a live energy monitoring dashboard for solar plants.

💡 Visual + Textual Recommendation System – Developed hybrid recommendation engines for lighting products.

🎯 Lead Scoring & Email Automation – Implemented predictive models and GenAI-driven email workflows.

🧠 BERT-Based NLP Pipelines – Built summarization, sentiment analysis, and NER models for enterprise text data.

📷 Solar Panel Fault Detection – Used SOTA computer vision for segmentation and classification of solar faults.

🛰️ Solar Potential Estimation – Detected optimal rooftop areas for solar panel installation using satellite imagery.

I’m excited to contribute to teams that are building the next generation of AI products. If you're hiring or know of a remote opportunity where my background fits, I’d love to connect!
